Everything License
===================

This is kinda weird because it lets you use this code or software or whatever under whatever
license you want, free, open source, proprietary, whatever. There is one thing you aren't 
allowed to do: charge money, or Pokemon cards, or floppy disks, or bananas, or anything for
this code/software/computer stuff.
